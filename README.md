 Communication:
Communication with the rover is setup via two transceivers, one at the base station and another on rover with suitable gains. On base station we are using a direction antenna for high strength. On rover we are using an omnidirectional antenna for better connectivity.
We are working on two different frequency bands for better control on the rover, we are working with 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands. Here 2.4GHz is used for transmitting and receiving control signals and 5GHz is used for live video feed from the cameras and it will insure sufficient bandwidth for camera feed.
Also, low RF modules are chosen as backup for potential signal losses. A central communication system is setup for overall controls and data for the rover.
